Population/Public Health Research Report and Presentation

Our research question was, "How can public health STI programs effectively utilize outbreak preparedness, detection, and response tools to mitigate the spread of sexually transmitted infections?"

Our methodology was a mix of quantitative and qualitative components. Data trends came from state of Michigan's Department of Health and Human Services.  Analysis and themese came from local hospital and health department community health assessments and improvement plans.

Found that using the SPACE 2.0 program, public health programs can assess funding implications.  This can also help in decision making in improvement plans

My main contribution was finding and extracting the public health data.
